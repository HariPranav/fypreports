Link Layer\n\n\nThe IEEE 802.x Link layers are a family of standards that enable intercommunications between equipment from a variety of manufacturers\n\n\nLink layer communication is facilitated by Network Interface Cards (NICs) and the respective device drivers.Using those, a host can interact with the physical medium on which it resides.Any NIC has a unique identification number known as a\nMAC address which is issued by the NIC\u2019s manufacturer during NIC creation\n\n\n\u2022 There is no way to validate MAC address ownership whenever an ARP request or response is issued.\n\u2022 ARP is stateless. Whenever an ARP response is received, hosts will\ncreate or update a cache entry with the observed IP/MAC pair (regardless of them issuing an ARP request or not).\n\u2022 An initial ARP request can result in the requester\u2019s IP/MAC pair being cached by listening (for broadcasts) hosts; this is done to reduce ARP broadcast requests\n\n\n2. MITM Attacks\n\n\nThose ARP shortcomings can be leveraged by an attacker to launch man-in-the-middle attacks, where he/she can pose as just another host on the local network or even as a router.\n\n\nIf such attacks are executed successfully, the attacker can receive traffic destined for another host, inspect it or alter it and ultimately forward it to the original destination. Not only that, but the attacker can also receive, inspect or alter the traffic from the original destination and ultimately\nforward it back to the original sender.\n\n\n\n\n3. ARP Attacks\n\n\nARP poisoning can be exploited to add fake information between two communication peers into a local network. In a scenario in which M (the attacker) wants to listen to all the traffic between A and B, Mwould have to send fake IP/MAC pairs to both A and B, making himself the Man-in-the-Middle   \n\n\n\u2022 Normal: ARP broadcasts are normal from both clients and servers, including network devices at a reasonable flow.\n\u2022 Suspicious: Tens, hundreds, or even thousands of ARP broadcast messages within a small time window.\n\n\nEven without knowing off hand what legit device can potentially have that MAC address on your network, but just based on the flow and speed of the ARP Requests, we can tell something is odd.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.a ARP poisioning:\n\n\nThe following are the steps for a successful attack:\n1. M would pretend to be B to A: it will send a gratuitous ARP reply with the pair: IP_B->MAC_M\n2. M would pretend to be A to B: it will send a gratuitous ARP reply with the pair: IP_A->MAC_M\nBecause of the TTL in hosts ARP caches, an attacker would need to send these packets at intervals lower than the timeout (usually every 30 seconds is a good choice).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3b. Detection of ARP on the Stack\n\n\nHere we can see that the host is Kali machine \n\n\n\n\nUnder the alert signature we can see that suricata can detect the different signatures\n\n\n\n\nHere under the alert category generated we can see that that see that the IDS can identify that there is potentially bad traffic\n\n\n\n\nIn the dashbord below we can see the different fields such as \n\n\n\n\nDestination IP vs count of the packets\n\n\nThe duration of ARP sent which is abnormally high \n\n\nThe Protocol UDP which is higher than TCP which carries the ICMP message protocol\n\n\nThe Orgin IP of the ARP request which is abnormally high",
