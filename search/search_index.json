If such attacks are executed successfully, the attacker can receive traffic destined for another host, inspect it or alter it and ultimately forward it to the original destination. Not only that, but the attacker can also receive, inspect or alter the traffic from the original destination and ultimately forward it back to the original sender. ARP Attacks ARP poisoning can be exploited to add fake information between two communication peers into a local network. In a scenario in which M (the attacker) wants to listen to all the traffic between A and B, Mwould have to send fake IP/MAC pairs to both A and B, making himself the Man-in-the-Middle \u2022 Normal: ARP broadcasts are normal from both clients and servers, including network devices at a reasonable flow. \u2022 Suspicious: Tens, hundreds, or even thousands of ARP broadcast messages within a small time window. Even without knowing off hand what legit device can potentially have that MAC address on your network, but just based on the flow and speed of the ARP Requests, we can tell something is odd. ARP poisioning: The following are the steps for a successful attack: 1. M would pretend to be B to A: it will send a gratuitous ARP reply with the pair: IP_B->MAC_M 2. M would pretend to be A to B: it will send a gratuitous ARP reply with the pair: IP_A->MAC_M Because of the TTL in hosts ARP caches, an attacker would need to send these packets at intervals lower than the timeout (usually every 30 seconds is a good choice). GOKUL JS Analyzing & Detecting IP Layer Attacks The IP Layer The IP layer\u2019s functions are related to how packets are transferred from one hop to another. Source and destination IP addresses are used by the IP layer for inter-host communication. IP addresses reside in the IP header of the IP packet. It should be noted that IP packets travel individually as they are directed to their destination. For example, IP packets from the same source that are traveling to the same destination could get there through different routes. During packet delivery, a lot of things can go wrong. The IP layer has no built-in mechanism to identify when a packet gets lost, expired, or dropped. The Transport protocol or the application itself is responsible for identifying and resolving any packet loss. IPV4 VERSION: Version of the IP protocol (4 bits), which is 4 for IPv4 HLEN: IP header length (4 bits), which is the number of 32 bit words in the header. The minimum value for this field is 5 and the maximum is 15. Type of service: Low Delay, High Throughput, Reliability (8 bits) Total Length: Length of header + Data (16 bits), which has a minimum value 20 bytes and the maximum is 65,535 bytes. Identification: Unique Packet Id for identifying the group of fragments of a single IP datagram (16 bits) Flags: 3 flags of 1 bit each : reserved bit (must be zero), do not fragment flag, more fragments flag (same order) Fragment Offset: Represents the number of Data Bytes ahead of the particular fragment in the particular Datagram. Specified in terms of number of 8 bytes, which has the maximum value of 65,528 bytes. Time to live: Datagram\u2019s lifetime (8 bits), It prevents the datagram to loop through the network by restricting the number of Hops taken by a Packet before delivering to the Destination. Protocol: Name of the protocol to which the data is to be passed (8 bits) Header Checksum: 16 bits header checksum for checking errors in the datagram header Length (IP header length): A fieldcontaining the length of the IP header. Total Length (IP datagram/packet length): Specifies the length of the IP packet that includes the IP header and the user data. Fragment(ed) Offset: In case of a packet being divided, the fragmentation offset value will be used to reassemble the packet. Let\u2019s elaborate more on some important and, oftentimes, abused IPv4 fields. First, an IP Version field exists indicating whether we are dealing with IPv4 or IPv6 (valid version numbers are 4 and 6 only). If an invalid IP Version value is identified at the host or router level, the datagram/packet must be silently discarded according to the respective RFC.","title":"Final Year Project Report"},{"location":"#final-year-project-report","text":"","title":"Final Year Project Report"},{"location":"#index","text":"ARP Attacks MITM Attacks The IEEE 802.x Link layers are a family of standards that enable intercommunications between equipment from a variety of manufacturers Link layer communication is facilitated by Network Interface Cards (NICs) and the respective device drivers.Using those, a host can interact with the physical medium on which it resides.Any NIC has a unique identification number known as a MAC address which is issued by the NIC\u2019s manufacturer during NIC creation \u2022 There is no way to validate MAC address ownership whenever an ARP request or response is issued. \u2022 ARP is stateless.
