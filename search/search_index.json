Whenever an ARP response is received, hosts will create or update a cache entry with the observed IP/MAC pair (regardless of them issuing an ARP request or not). \u2022 An initial ARP request can result in the requester\u2019s IP/MAC pair being cached by listening (for broadcasts) hosts; this is done to reduce ARP broadcast requests MITM Attacks Those ARP shortcomings can be leveraged by an attacker to launch man-in-the-middle attacks, where he/she can pose as just another host on the local network or even as a router. If such attacks are executed successfully, the attacker can receive traffic destined for another host, inspect it or alter it and ultimately forward it to the original destination. Not only that, but the attacker can also receive, inspect or alter the traffic from the original destination and ultimately forward it back to the original sender. ARP Attacks ARP poisoning can be exploited to add fake information between two communication peers into a local network. In a scenario in which M (the attacker) wants to listen to all the traffic between A and B, Mwould have to send fake IP/MAC pairs to both A and B, making himself the Man-in-the-Middle \u2022 Normal: ARP broadcasts are normal from both clients and servers, including network devices at a reasonable flow. \u2022 Suspicious: Tens, hundreds, or even thousands of ARP broadcast messages within a small time window. Even without knowing off hand what legit device can potentially have that MAC address on your network, but just based on the flow and speed of the ARP Requests, we can tell something is odd. ARP poisioning: The following are the steps for a successful attack: 1. M would pretend to be B to A: it will send a gratuitous ARP reply with the pair: IP_B->MAC_M 2. M would pretend to be A to B: it will send a gratuitous ARP reply with the pair: IP_A->MAC_M Because of the TTL in hosts ARP caches, an attacker would need to send these packets at intervals lower than the timeout (usually every 30 seconds is a good choice).
